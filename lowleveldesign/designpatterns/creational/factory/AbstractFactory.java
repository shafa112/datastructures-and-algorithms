 * Abstract Factory is a creational design pattern that lets you produce families of related objects without specifying their concrete classes.
 * A factory of factories; a factory that groups the individual but related/dependent factories together without specifying their concrete classes.
 * When to use?
 * When there are interrelated dependencies with not-that-simple creation logic involved
 *
 * Example: https://github.com/shadab005/DataStructureAndAlgo/blob/master/design_pattern/src/design_pattern/creational/AbstractFactory.java
